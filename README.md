# Shared Automations
A collection of scripts and automations to share with the community.  

Each platform will have its own folder, and within that folder each script or automation will be in its own folder with any relevant assets and documentation.

**Fireside IT and its staff may or may not be the author of these scripts.**  
We will credit authors for both complete copies or forks of scripts.
